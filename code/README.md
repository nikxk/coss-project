# Code Folder 

The code is organized as follows:
- `starters` contains initial experimental work in Python
- `MATLAB work` contains the work done in MATLAB which motivated the results. It has data and plots, some of which were used for the presentation.
- `simult_play` contains more development work in Python. This is a less baked version of the final submission.
- The files in the folder constitute the main submission of code. `agent.py` and `games.py` define the classes, `main.ipynb` is used to generate the plots and results.

The Python packages needed to run the code is collected in `requirements.txt`. To install them, you can create a virtual environment and perform `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
